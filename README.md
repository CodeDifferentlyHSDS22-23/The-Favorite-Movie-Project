# The-Favorite-Movie-Project

Objective: The objective of this lab is to create a simple website to track and display your favorite movies. You will practice using HTML elements such as headings, horizontal rule, and paragraphs to structure and present the content.

Instructions:

1. Open your preferred text editor.

2. Create a new HTML file and save it as "favorite-movies.html".

3. Set up the basic structure of the HTML document by adding the doctype declaration, `<html>` element, and `<head>` element.

4. Inside the `<head>` element, add the `<title>` element and give it a title of your choice.

5. Open the `<body>` element.

6. Create an `<h1>` element and set it as the title of your website. For example, "My Favorite Movies".

7. Create an `<h2>` element and set it as the subtitle of your website. For example, "Top Movies of All Time".

8. Add a horizontal rule `<hr>` to visually separate the title and subtitle from the movie content.

9. Create three `<h3>` elements, each representing one of your favorite movies. For each `<h3>` element, set the text to the title of the movie.

10. After each `<h3>` element, add a `<p>` element to describe why you like that movie.

11. Customize the content of the `<h3>` and `<p>` elements to match your favorite movies and their descriptions.

12. Save the HTML file.

13. Open the HTML file in a web browser to see the result.

14. Optional: Feel free to further modify and enhance your website by adding additional elements or styling using CSS.

15. Take a screenshot of your completed website.

16. Share your screenshot in the Q&A section to showcase your favorite movies and inspire others.

Note: Remember to refer to the original transcript for the specific movie titles and descriptions mentioned by the instructor.
